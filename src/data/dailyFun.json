Since breaking his hip in an accident he has used a walking frame with wheels. He was inspired by the treatment he received from the NHS after his accident and when he was treated for cancer.</p><p>As planned, he has completed the laps before his 100th birthday on April 30. His original target was a very modest 1000 pounds. That aim was quickly blown away when his campaign garnered media attention from around the globe.</p><p>Cap Tom Moore's actions should inspire us to think about how we can contribute more to helping others!</p>",
