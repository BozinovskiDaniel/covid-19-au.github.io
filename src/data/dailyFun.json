            "content": "<p>Pictured above is Paramdeep Singh, a resident of Canberra that is coordinating a team of Australian Sikhs who have been cooking, packing and delivering 100 meals a day to the doorsteps of fellow Canberrans. A core concept in Sikhism is the practice of the \"langar\" or a \"free kitchen\". People are fed at the langar regardless of  religion, caste, colour, creed, age, gender or social status, to uphold the principle of equality among all people.<p/><p>When interviewed by ABC News, they said, \"Any person who is not able to cook for themselves, we are trying to provide food.\" This is just one of a number if heartwarming stories coming out of Canberra.
