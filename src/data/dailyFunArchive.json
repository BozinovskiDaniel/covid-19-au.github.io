She selflessly suggested to her mother to buy toilet paper to help out people in their neighbourhood who may not have had the opportunity to buy it.</p><p>The best friends have gone around their neighbourhood handing out the toilet paper and tissues to those in pensioner cottages and those who are too unwell to go out. Their thoughtfulness and generosity has touched the hearts of many, especially the elderly who are very grateful for their actions.</p><p>The actions of Lucy and Addyson highlight that it is important to carry out acts of kindness and help those in need, rather than stock piling, which makes it more difficult for those who are vulnerable. Thank you Lucy and Addyson for doing your best to support the people in your neighbourhood!</p>",

You are a great example to how Australians can still unite and contribute to help combat the outbreak during self-isolation at home. Extraordinary work Australia!</p><p>If you know how to sew or would like to donate materials please contact gownsfordoctors@gmail.com!</p>",
