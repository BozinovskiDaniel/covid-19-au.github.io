A core concept in Sikhism is the practice of the \"langar\" or a \"free kitchen\". People are fed at the langar regardless of  religion, caste, colour, creed, age, gender or social status, to uphold the principle of equality among all people.<p/><p>When interviewed by ABC News, they said, \"Any person who is not able to cook for themselves, we are trying to provide food.\" This is just one of a number if heartwarming stories coming out of Canberra.

You are a great example to how Australians can still unite and contribute to help combat the outbreak during self-isolation at home. Extraordinary work Australia!</p><p>If you know how to sew or would like to donate materials please contact gownsfordoctors@gmail.com!</p>",
