In Hong Kong alone, SARS infected over 1,700 people and killed nearly 300. Since then, people in Hong Kong have never abandoned their sanitation routines.",
                    "After the experience of SARS, Hong Kong doubled down to prepare for the next crisis and use its hard-won lessons to combat COVID-19. The Special Administrative Region had set up response capabilities and a preparedness plans. Hong Kong has had a Preparedness Plan for Influenza Pandemic in place for many years. It details 3 response levels – Alert, Serious and Emergency which aim to clearly demonstrate the current disease situation to the public and guide the city’s response.",
                    "When coronavirus broke out early this year, people in Hong Kong did not think twice – they  quickly put on their facemasks, slathered on hand sanitiser and obediently stayed indoors. People were accustomed to wearing masks for every sniffle or cough and getting their  temperature taken when arriving at the Hong Kong airport.",

Hong Kong began to welcome home residents and students who had been stuck overseas. Since then, there has been a resurgence of confirmed cases. However, the jump in cases was not surprising to scientists in Hong Kong because they knew that the pandemic would come in waves.",

With this in mind, the development of rapid test kits or point of care tests could pave the way for widespread, on-the-spot testing. This will not only allow us to get a far more accurate picture of the number of active cases, but also will facilitate the tracing of cases and allow essential workers the peace of mind to know when they can return to work and their families if isolating.",
