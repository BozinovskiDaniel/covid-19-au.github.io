            "summary": "Privacy concerns have been raised over Australia’s new coronavirus tracing app. The government services minister, Stuart Robert, has said that the data would remain “securely encrypted on your phone” unless you tested positive for Covid-19, in which case it would be accessed by state health authorities. However, digital experts have said that the federal government should formally make data collected from its Covid-19 tracing app exempt from use by law enforcement and “decentralise” the way it notifies users about potential contacts with the virus if it wants to allay privacy concerns."
