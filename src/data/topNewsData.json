Australia was the second country, after the United States, to call for an independent inquiry into the global pandemic, a move which sparked a diplomatic row with China. But last night, at a meeting of the World Health Assembly (WHA) in Geneva, China indicated it would likely back a European Union motion that called for an \"impartial, independent and comprehensive\" evaluation of the response to the global outbreak. However, Beijing's embassy in Canberra issued a statement saying the inquiry being considered by the WHA was \"totally different\" to the one Australia proposed, saying that to claim vindication was \"nothing but a joke\"."
